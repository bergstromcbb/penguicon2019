        We still have a few key positions that need to be filed on the programming team. We are still looking for a Content Liaison and a Sched Master.  The job descriptions can be found here and if you are interested in either position please email conchair19@penguicon.org. If you are looking to help with programming in other ways please contact programming@penguicon.org .

        We are still working on the programming for 2019 but if you want to get an idea of what our programming looks like take a look at what we did in 2018.

        *In the interest of full transparency, this year we are publishing the suggestions made by our attendees and whether those suggestions will make it to programming. No identifying information will be given – only whether or not a presenter has been identified.
