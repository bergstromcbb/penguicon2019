        The Writers’ Block is a convention-run bookstore devoted to the promotion and sale of books by our Guests of Honor, Featured Guests, and any attending authors who wish to participate, free of charge. Staff will be on hand to help readers find just the right book. The Writers’ Block takes place 305 & the Bookstore.  Authors and literary fans are encouraged to hang out; the rooms will serve as a gathering spot for lovers of words and fans of Penguicon’s participating authors.
