        Like many Science Fiction conventions in the mid-west, our attendees often make ribbon-gathering into an event of its own via trading. While some ribbons represent official matters like who is staff or who is a presenter, most of them are fun, even silly ways to express yourself.
        <br /><br />
        While you are welcome to bring your own ribbons purchased anywhere, we purchase ribbons in bulk from one vendor in order to bring the cost down as much as possible.
        <br /><br />
        If you purchased ribbons for Penguicon through this page, they will be available for you at the Registration desk during the convention.  If you missed our deadline, you will need to purchase your ribbons independently. For questions about ribbons, email registration@penguicon.org.

        Ribbon Ordering is now open and can be submitted on this form.
